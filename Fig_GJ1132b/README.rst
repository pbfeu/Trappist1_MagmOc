==============

This figure shows the solidification time of the mantle of GJ1132b for different initial water masses and different efficiencies of the atmospheric escape, calculated with `vplanet` and compare to the results by `Schaefer et al. (2016) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/829/2/63/meta>`_
