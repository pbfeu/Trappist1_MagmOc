This repository contains folders for nearly all figures and one table in
Barth et al. (2020). These folders are linked in the manuscript in the
corresponding figure/table captions.

To reproduce the figures presented in the manuscript, you find the necessary
files to run vplanet and detailed instructions and scripts to produce the figures
from the paper.
Before you start any runs of `vplanet`, please clone the `code <https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet>`_ onto your machine and make sure to add `vplanet` to your path.

In case you encounter any problems or you have any questions about the model,
please `contact me <pb94@st-andrews.ac.uk>`_.
